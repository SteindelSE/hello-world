GitHub Tutorial for Refresher Purposes on the New Github

My name is Derek, the sole proprietor of SteindelSE. I am commiting changes to the readme in a separate branch in order merge them back into the main branch. 

**Simplicity of this tutorial should not be confused for a lack of experience. I have experience using git in large open-source projects and in corporate settings. I am also proficient in using TFS as a version control system in a corporate environment.**
